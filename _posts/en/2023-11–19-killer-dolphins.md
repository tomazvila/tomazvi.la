## Mosad animals

In January 2022, Hamas, while presenting their naval forces on YouTube, said \[1\]:
> The naval forces are one of the main pillars of martyr Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigade power
> this unit is distinguished by its high capabilities and its competence in combat
> The unit is tasked with defending the coast and cunducting special operations at sea
> says Abu Suhaib Commander in Al-Qassam's naval forces
> martyr Muhammad Abu Sam'an got mission to surveil and track zionist enemy positions, warships, and military bases both at sea and no the northern martiime border
> Martyr Muhammad Abu Anas discovered a dolphin that enemy used to hunt down members of our naval forces at sea

And it was he who first removed devices attached to the dolphin that were meant to kill members of the Al-Qassam Brigades' naval forces:

This is not the first time Israel has been accused of using animals for military purposes. While we are tracked by pigeon drones, Palestinians are tracked by birds like these:

Once, Iran accused Mossad\[2\] and the CIA \[3\] of using lizards, chameleons, and other types of reptiles to spy on their nuclear program.
> their skin attracts atomic waves and that they were nuclear spies who wanted to find out where inside the Islamic Republic of Iran we have uranium mines and where we are engaged in atomic activities

There were also Zionist wild boars \[4\] destroying arable fields in the west...

So, I guess it's no wonder that after this Hamas statement, a lot of memes like these were created:

(On the hat, it's written "dolphin.")

Austin Powers: sharks with lasers on their heads. (By the way, Israel was also blamed for sending sharks to kill people on the coasts of Egypt \[5\])

Even the official Israel Twitter account joined in the mocking:

But I think war dolphins are not a made-up thing because it's not the first time I've heard about dolphins being used for war purposes.

## Sad destiny of Ukraine dolphins
In soviet union everything was shit except piss. Dolphin program is not an exception. The Soviets experienced difficulties in the early stages of the research, but most of the problems were solved. A number of newly established bases suggest that the Soviets are training marine animals for military purposes. The Americans wrote in the CIA October 1976 report \[7\]:
> Within the next year, the Soviets could train marine mammals to be used in military operational systems such as diver assistance and equipment recovery in the black sea The next steps, possible within 2 years, might be training of the animals for more sophisticated tasks such as placement of packages on ships and ship protection, as well as for use in areas outside the Black Sea. The training achievements would be contingent on continuing Soviet success in maintaining a stable of healthy animals and overcoming past training difficulties.

According to the History Channel, until 1973 most dolphins were bought on the black market. Captured dolphins were kept in cramped cages separated from their social groups. Instead of spending time with their dolphin friends, they were forced to spend time with Soviet trainers. While the Americans used the gingerbread method to train their dolphins, the Soviets used the whip. The dolphins' cages were drained of water so that they could resist as little as possible. Muzzles and other restraining devices were placed. Dolphins were deliberately starved to make them as dependent as possible on their trainers. The Soviets even experimented with implanting electrodes in the dolphins' brains, but they were unable to find a reliable way of not killing the dolphin and allowing it to be controlled by radio waves. \[8\]

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the dolphin programme, with its entire base in Sevastopol, passed to Ukraine. Without Soviet funding, it was difficult for the Ukrainians to maintain the dolphins. Scientists working with the dolphins even worked extra jobs to buy food for them. The dolphins were given other jobs. Some of them did therapy sessions:

Others took part in performances for tourists:

\[9\]

However, this did not solve their financial problems and in 2000, the Ukrainians, not wanting to starve the dolphins, sold them to Iran. \[10\]

The Ukrainian dolphin programme resumed in 2012 but has only lasted 2 years since the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. RIA Novosti reports that the Russians had plans to retrain the dolphins to serve Russian military purposes. Russian engineers boasted that they had more advanced technology than the backward Ukrainian nation and that they were going to use it with trophy dolphins.
4 years after the occupation of Crimea, the Ukrainians announced that the Russians had failed in their plan. Boris Babin, spokesman for the Crimeans in Transcaucasia, said that the dolphins had died patriotically by going on hunger strike and refusing to obey the instructions of the Russian trainers. \[11\]
The Russians of course denied the Ukrainian claims. But Vladimir Oleinik Kyiv's politicians are constantly looking for Moscow's hand everywhere and everyone who is sober can see that this is only propaganda and rumours.  The dolphins have not been properly cared for since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Dmitry Belik, a Russian Duma deputy, claimed that some dolphins were sold and the rest died of natural causes.
I think it is obvious to everyone that the Russians are active on the information warfare front, so it is difficult to say what really happened to the Ukrainian dolphins, but I think they did not survive because in 2016 the Ministry of Defence launched a tender to buy 5 dolphins \[12\]. The dolphins were bought from the Moscow Utrish Dolphinarium. The distribution of the dolphins was not explained. So in my opinion, patriotic or not, there are no Ukrainian dolphins left in Sevastopol.

## But why dolphins?
Even with today's advances in new technologies, no man-made robot in the water can match a dolphin. Even North Korea has a dolphin programme!

Dolphins can dive very deep and have exceptional echolocation. Dolphins are also some of the smartest animals on earth. Dolphins have been trained by the US Navy since 1967 to detect enemies, submarines or mines. Dolphins are also used to help find lost swimmers. To help recover equipment lost on the seabed. \[14, 15\]

I think it is quite likely that the Russians are using the aforementioned dolphins from the Moscow Dolphinarium in 2016 to guard military facilities in Crimea \[16\]. Dolphins are perfect for this because they do not lose consciousness even when they are asleep. \[17\]

## Not only dolphins
Dolphins are not the only marine animals used for military purposes. 2019m. A Norwegian ship was attacked by a friendly Beluga whale named Hvaldimir (Hval is Norwegian for whale, Vladimir is ...). Equipment found on the whale suggests that the whales are being used for espionage. \[18\]
In addition to the 70 dolphins, the USA has nearly 30 sea lions. Sea lions have excellent underwater vision, which can help find lost equipment or enemy divers. Seals are being trained also \[19, 20\].

## So can dolphins kill?
The Americans say dolphins cannot kill because they cannot distinguish between their enemies in the water. But I personally do not believe that. The Soviets boasted that their trained dolphins could distinguish between their own submarine and the enemy just by the vibrations of the propeller's rotation. Hamas boasted that it had captured a dolphin that had killed one of their soldiers. Iran threatened to hunt kamikaze killer dolphins in the Persian Gulf. Dolphins have also been used in a number of wars. So I would not be surprised that dolphins have killed more than one diver.
