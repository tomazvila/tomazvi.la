# I'm not racist but

Every day on my way to work, I pass by Vdu buildings. In the summer, they were restoring one of them. I was surprised that the workers who were restoring the building didn't speak Lithuanian to each other. Actually, maybe it should not have been surprising, because most of them were not white men. They were communicating with each other, not in Russian, not in Polish, not in Ukrainian, not in Uzbek, not in Indian, not even in Spanish, but in clean and seemingly correct English. The building was first constructed during the interwar period. Probably belongs to some kind of heritage site. I saw the windows have been restored and to my surprise they have not been replaced by plastic ones, as I have seen in many places in the Old Town :(. I guess that an ordinary builder would not be allowed to work on an interwar architectural object of Kaunas. But there was always a regular worker's Volskwagen Sharan parked next to the arch passing. Everything is clear about the Sharan, but I don't understand anything else. Strange. Why are these people here? Aren't there any Lithuanians who can do the same job? Too expensive?

Next to the arch passing the trap was set. It was raining quite heavily that day. The rain didn't stop me and instead of working from home, I chose to work in the office, so I took my daily route to work. The construction workers were sheltering from the rain in the arch passing. I think that the extraordinary builders are very lucky that they are not ordinary Lithuanians, and I am very lucky that they were under the arch passing. A lady with a scarf and a puffy skirt soon introduced herself. Would you be interested in Hugo Boss perfume? I have no idea what language the saleswoman was offering her wares in, but I doubt that the builders managed to understand her. Working in the rain or enduring a gypsy woman's attempts to push her wares through? Lucky they're not Lithuanians... Although not... Gypsies don't speak Lithuanian. I know, because a gypsy kid (more about him later) once tried to persuade me, to give him a ride with my longboard. I guess. I didn't understand anything he was explaining. But his movements when he was talking were the same as mine when I was riding the pumping board. I'd love to give them a ride, but I don't trust him.

When I first moved here, I thought the Erasmus students from the south lived behind the wall. From time to time there are angry voices, fights. 15 minutes of shouting and then peace. Ah, that southern hot-headedness I thought... But one day I found a 2019 AMG 5.5 Mercedes S-Class in the yard. 7 Gypsies got out of it. Then I realised that this was not Spanish at all and definitely not Erasmus students living here. And where did they get such a luxury car? What are they doing if they only speak their own language?

# If you look like a duck, you quack like a duck...
The day before yesterday I was walking home from work after my Black Friday night shift. I took the route from the cathedral, through liberty avenue, past the "vingių dubingių" to the blc. I saw an Opel Zafira with emergency lights on near Šilas grocery shop. Doesn't look like anything too unusual, although there is usually a police car in that exact place. Suddenly I saw two thin guys running out. One of them had familiar face to me, but I couldn't remember where I've seen him. They quickly jumped into the car, drove to the Soboras Cathedral, turned around and drove at a really unacceptable speed down the Freedom Avenue, where people normally walk. I could just hear the tyres squealing and, as the car turned towards the "vingių dubingių", I did not see it again until I reached my own yard. There I found the very same Zafira. And then I realised. At first I still had my doubts, as I had a few beers after work. But, yes, it was that same young face. Definitely a gypsy. I know, because he literally lives behind the wall of my flat. The same child who asked me to ride my skateboard.
Did the gypsies run out of alcohol and stop by for a drink? No... it's 10:30 pm...  Unless to steal. Possibly... You know that saying, if you look like a duck, you quack like a duck, you must be a duck?

# The Gypsies problem

> "People are afraid to accept Gypsies and the second thing is not
the problem of the Gypsies, but the problem of all people is that they probably have some shadow pennies, some money or something and they don't want to show it. You know, we have changed a lot. Whether Lithuania as a whole has changed in the way it accepts us, I don't know," says Kvik.

> "That a gypsy is a thief, that a gypsy cannot be trusted, as if he is a liar, a cheat", said one Gypsy.
> These are the words that the Gypsies community is confronted with every day. They said that the scathing remarks from the public are hurtful.
> "The comments are very cruel", said another Gypsy.

> "A gypsy has to steal something or he has to do all kinds of nonsense. It's some kind of fiction that comes from somewhere. I don't agree at all that all Gypsies are criminals," said Ištvanas Kvik, chairman of the Lithuanian Gypsies community.

> "There are certainly many girls who come and say: 'We agreed over the phone that we would be hired, but we came, and when the employer sees that we came dressed in Gypsy clothes, with long hair, a scarf and a skirt, he says: 'Thanks, but you are a Gypsy, we won't hire you. It's really offensive," commented Vaiva Poškaitė-Tomaševič, head of the Baltic Gypsies Association.

> Svetlana Novopolskaja, Director of the Gypsies Community Centre, who has been working with the community for many years, identifies two main challenges that prevent Gypsies from entering the labour market. She identifies a lack of qualifications and negative attitudes. "They have low literacy levels, no professions, and therefore cannot compete on the labour market. In addition, most employers are reluctant to hire Roma, they do not hide it, they openly say they will not hire them because of their nationality," she says. \[2\]

I still don't understand a lot of things about gypsies. For example, I don't understand why all the gypsy boys, even when they play outside, wear shiny oxford shoes and a nicer shirt than I wear to work. Or why the girls always wear skirts. But I think I am beginning to understand a few things. The Gypsies are hindered in their integration into normal social life, which is normal for all of us, by illiteracy, debt, lack of general work and social skills, lack of proper qualifications, lack of knowledge of the Lithuanian language, and the resistance of their relatives to their personal job searches. But its no wonder the relatives are not going to resist when the majority of people, myself included, have a skewed view of gypsies. I once saw a post on Facebook in which a Kaunas woman shared a post in a group trying to draw attention to and warn against a gypsy woman walking down Freedom Avenue with a child and asking for money. I remember there were a lot of angry and negative comments about the gypsies under the post. Unfortunately I couldn't find the post, because Facebook is a pile of crap, but more on that next time

Facebook search not working and definitely not gypsies

It seems to be a vicious circle. As gypsies close themselves off into their own communities, it becomes extremely difficult for them to make a legal and legitimate living, so there is nothing left to do but to engage in activities that seem suspicious to us. As a result of these suspicious activities, society further alienates the gypsies and forces them to isolate themselves even more from the rest of the world. How to break the cycle? Do the gypsies themselves make an effort? Are we ourselves trying to accept them and include them in our society?
I do not know, it seems too complicated, but the one time a child asked me to give him a longboard for a ride, I pushed him away. Now it is too late. It's snowing outside and by spring I'll probably be living somewhere else. I'm trying to justify to myself now that I saw a gypsy child _possibly_ running away from a _possibly_ crime scene. I'm leaning towards the idea that if I gave a skateboard, the money would just be thrown away. I doubt that my decision would have contributed significantly to solving this problem. On the one hand, I think it would take the initiative of politicians with more power. However, at least here in Kaunas, the community and the problem is too small for the municipality to pay attention to it, so maybe we should take the initiative ourselves? What do you think? Write to me anywhere and anyhow!
